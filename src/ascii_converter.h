/// Converts vectors to an ASCII-art-representation and writes them to the target TE3D_Surface.
/// Returns true on success.
/// @param[in] vectors: The vectors to render.
/// @param[in] count: The number of vectors. If TE3D_VECTORFORMAT_LINES or TE3D_VECTORFORMAT_TRIANGLES is specified, count contains the number of indices to render.
/// @param[in] target: The target char-surface to write into.
/// @param[in] indices: Contains the indices of the vectors to connect (see remarks for parameter 'format').
/// @param[in] format: The vertex-format. Interpretes how vertices are connected when rendered. If TE3D_VECTORFORMAT_POINTS is specified, this field
///		   has to be NULL. When specifying TE3D_VECTORFORMAT_LINES, indices[] is a pointer to an array of TE3D_VectorIndex2 structs and
///		   when specifying TE3D_VECTORFORMAT_TRIANGLES the pointer type is an array of TE3D_VectorIndex3.
/// @param[in] zBuffer: The pointer for the Z-buffer. You can set it to NULL if you don't want to get the Z-buffer, but it's recommended for performance
///			reasons at least to create one. The function automatically creates a buffer if no one specified, but that causes a performance penalty.
